    Base run is result of capstone I work. At default values.
        SWDOWN is nonreactive
        SWDIR/DIF are zero

    Experimenting with different rad schemes
        14/14 is stable from base
        
        Disabling suite
        Enabling 14/4 using older rrtmg for shortwave.
            Attempting to re-run 100x
                Failed
        Attempting 1/1 100x
            Failed
        Attempting 4/4 100x

        Attempting 24/24 GPU enabled RRTMG on machine with no GPU 100x
            Not immediately failing
            Failed 1x
            GOT ACTUAL output
            
    Attempting BO w/ 24/24
        Still not enough variation for purposes
        DIR/DIF are no longer 0
        Steep dropoff after solar zenith? Investigating source
    FOR ALL FUTURE RUNS SHIFTING TO SW/LW 24/24
